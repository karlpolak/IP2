However, these tolled links don't show this in their link cost, nor is their flow affected. This is really weird, because the link costs for tolled links can NEVER be lower than the charged toll value plus the free flow cost. The only explanation that we could see for this is implementation mistakes. However, we think that the implementation mistake is not in our hands.
