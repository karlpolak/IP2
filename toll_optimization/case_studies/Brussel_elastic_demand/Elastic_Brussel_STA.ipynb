    "4. When you now want to run an elastic assignemt after all parameters are tuned, it is essential to add an additional loop where you determine how much the demand matrix will change depending on toll values and route choice. This can be done by checking each time after an assignment whether or not the change in skim matrix will have a significant effect. To get in this loop, you will first run an assignment with a random toll and determine how much the demand data deviates. A threshold of a specific number of iterations (here 10) or a lower bound on the max deviation per OD pair (here 5) will put a stop to the iterating step over multiple STA's to create slightly differend OD matrices in each iteration. The desired effect is a convergence of demand for the given toll. With this converged demand we can finally do the actual STA and compute the objective value.\n",
    "  \n",
    "   A sidenote is that sometimes rows or columns dissapear in the skim matrix due to the fact that their respective rows/columns in the previous OD matrix where filled with all zeroes. Due to this, the size of the matrix is not the same as the fixed elasticity matrix B. To solve this, an additional piece of code is added where in the case of such zero-row or -column, one random value in it will be changed to a very small number (here 0.0001)."
