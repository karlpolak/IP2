    "4. When you now want to run an elastic assignemt, it is essential to add an additional loop where you determine how much the demand matrix will change depending on toll values and route choice. This can be done by checking each time after an assignment whether or not the change in skim matrix will have a significant effect. To get in this loop, you will first run an assignment with a random toll and determine how much the demand data deviates. A threshold of a specific number of iterations (here 10) or a lower bound on the max deviation per OD pair (here 5) will put a stop to the iterating step over multiple STA's. \n"

    "5. The last step is preparing for the Heeds iterations. The outer loop will decide on the best toll value, by ‘randomly’ trying toll values within a given range. To do this, the full network (containing roads, centroids and connectors) should preferably be saved to avoid reloading these files each iteration. In the elastic use-case, only the network remains static and is saved with a given path. The OD however will change here, exactly because of the elasticity matrix. It is not saved, but continuously updated each step of the process. What could be useful is saving the original OD so you do not lose this!\n"
