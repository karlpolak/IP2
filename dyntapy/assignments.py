"""
    The DiGraph format of networkx is very flexible in its formatting.
    We describe below the semantics and labelling requirements for the DiGraph in
    order to use the assignments in dyntapy.

    All nodes and links need to have fully specified attributes for a subset of
    the General Modeling Network Specification (GMNS), see
    https://github.com/zephyr-data-specs/GMNS.


    For the links we need:
    'from_node_id', 'to_node_id', 'link_id', 'lanes',
    'capacity', 'length', 'free_speed'

    optional are:

    'geometry': shapely.geometry.LineString
        if it is not set we assume a straight line
        between the two nodes.

    'link_type': int,
        set to 1 for source connectors, -1 for sinks, 0 otherwise.

    'connector': bool,
        True if the link is a connector


    For the nodes:
    'node_id', 'x_coord', 'y_coord', 'ctrl_type', 'node_type'

    optional are:

    'centroid': bool,
        True if the node is a centroid

    The inclusion of the 'link_type', 'connector' and 'centroid' attributes are
    deviations from GMNS.

    The graph's nodes and edges need to be labelled consecutively and starting
    from 0.
    Many of the assignment algorithms also implicitly assume that the graph is strongly
    connected.
    This can be verified with networkx:

    >>> networkx.strongly_connected_components(g)

    If there is only a single element returned as the list of components, the graph
    is strongly connected.

    All of these requirements are met if dyntapy's functions for extracting the network
    from OpenStreetMap are used.

        Notes
        -----

        All the presented options utilize the same dynamic network loading (DNL) and
        route choice component, that is the iterative link transmission model [1]_
        and an
        iterative procedure to update a time-dependent arrival map, see [2]_.

        'i_ltm_aon' refers to a dynamic deterministic user equilibrium solution,
        note that for congested networks this is not guaranteed to converge below a
        gap of 0.01.

        'incremental_assignment' assigns the demands in chunks and updates the
        both costs and route choice after each DNL.

        Notes
        -----

        'msa' and 'dial_b' try to find the static deterministic
        user equilibrium.

        'msa' refers to the Method of Successive Averages, a well known method in
        Traffic Assignments that tends to zig-zag around equilibrium.


        'dial_b' refers to Dial's Algorithm B, a bush-based assignment
        algorithm [3]_. 

        'sun' returns a stochastic uncongested assignment of flows on the free-flow
        travel times that are determined by the lengths and speeds of the links. It
        is based on Dial's method, see [4]_. It does not consider the whole path set
        and rests the definition of 'efficient links' to allow for computations on an
        acyclic graph.

        'sun' and 'msa' are included for educational use.

        'dial_b' has been optimized and converges quickly even for
        large networks with thousands of links.
